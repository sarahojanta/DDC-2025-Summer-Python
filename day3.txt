"""
💎 Welcome to Code Island's Treasure Hunt Adventure!

Today you're building a *choose your own adventure* game.
Your mission: write a story with code where the player chooses their path.

🔍 What you’ll practice:
- Using `print()` and `input()` for storytelling
- Writing `if/elif/else` branches
- Keeping track of player choices and outcomes

🎮 Game Idea:
You're lost in the jungle with a map to a hidden treasure.
Every choice you make can lead you closer to the treasure... or total disaster 😵

🎨 Remix Challenges (do at least 2–3):
✅ Add more paths (like a hidden cave or river)
✅ Let the player collect items (like a torch or rope)
✅ Add a timer or limited number of moves
✅ Add random events with `random.choice()`
✅ Use emoji and ASCII art for flavor
✅ Add a restart option or loop

📸 When You Finish:
- Play each other's games in pairs
- Share one awesome/funny outcome with the class
- Submit your `.py` file or Replit link

# 📜 Start of the game

# 🧭 First choice
print("You see two paths in the jungle ahead:")

print("B - A sunny trail with animal footprints")
print("C - A swampy forest with gators running amok")

    if cave_choice == "enter":
        print("You use your phone flashlight and find... a golden chest! 💰")
        print("YOU WIN!")
    else:
        print("You run straight into a tree and knock yourself out. Game over 😵")

elif path == "B":
    print("\n☀️ You walk the sunny trail and see a monkey holding a shiny object.")
    monkey_choice = input("Do you CHASE the monkey or IGNORE it? ").lower()
    if monkey_choice == "chase":

        print("You find a trapdoor nearby and open it with the key... TREASURE! 🎉")
    else:
        print("You walk past and fall into a muddy pit. Stuck forever. Game over 💀")


else:
    print("You sit on the beach doing nothing. Eventually a crab steals your backpack. 🦀 Game over.")

# ✅ Your Turn!
# Try adding more paths, new characters, hidden items, or funny endings below.
# You can use if/elif/else again to make the story more complex.
